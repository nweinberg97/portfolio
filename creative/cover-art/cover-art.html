            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>Designed cover art for <strong>Home</strong>, an original song that reflects on the journey of finding clarity and 
                comfort within ourselves. Set against a soulful, indie/alternative sound, the song explores feeling lost amid life’s challenges and returning 
                to our inner “home”—a place of resilience and self-acceptance—no matter where life takes us. It is one of nine songs in an ongoing album project 
                I've been working on called <i>Everything Makes Music</i>, which explores how life’s experiences—no matter 
                how painful or challenging—can be transformed into something beautiful. The album revolves around the idea that 
                while life brings a variety of sounds, it’s up to us to compose those sounds into music.</p>

            readers to <strong>Search for the Good</strong> for further community and impact. A portion of the proceeds supports the Stroke
