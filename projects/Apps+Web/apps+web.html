                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Trybe Social is a platform designed to help individuals create close-knit groups of friends and connect with like-minded people. By linking users based on shared interests, location, and age group, Trybe Social fosters meaningful relationships and provides opportunities for users to engage in real-life activities and events with compatible individuals.</p>
                 
                <img src="projects-trybe-screenshot1.png" alt="Trybe Image 2" class="centered-image">
       
                <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
                <p>In today’s digital age, young adults often find it challenging to build close, authentic friendships, especially when relocating to a new city or working remotely. Trybe Social addresses this gap by creating a space where users can easily connect with others who share their interests and social vibe, making it simpler to <em>find your people</em> and form genuine connections.</p>
                
                <h3>Research and Ideation</h3>
                <p>The team explored social networking trends and conducted interviews with young adults to understand their challenges with meeting new people and sustaining friendships. Through this research, we identified that users desired a platform focused on fostering deeper connections rather than casual acquaintances. This insight led to Trybe Social’s mission of finding people with shared goals for connection and community.</p>
                
                <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intentional Matching:</strong> Trybe Social connects users based on shared interests, age group, and social preferences, ensuring compatibility and fostering authentic friendships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Building:</strong> Users can join or create “Trybes” — groups based on common interests, such as hiking or movie nights, and larger public Trybes for open events, creating both intimate and community-wide experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engagement Tools:</strong> Features include group chats for planning meetups, options to save profiles and Trybes, and the ability to share videos that reflect personal interests and experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Planning:</strong> Users can plan private and public events within Trybes, allowing them to meet in real life for activities like beach days or BBQs, fostering closer connections and lasting memories.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <img src="projects-trybe-screenshot2.png" alt="Trybe Image 3" class="centered-image">
                
                <h3>Implementation and Launch</h3>
                <p>The team built prototypes using Flutterflow to create an intuitive experience for users to join Trybes, connect with others, and organize events. After development, I helped the team successfully launch Trybe Social on the US App Store, making the platform available to a broad user base.</p>

                <h3>Current Status</h3>
                <p>The team continues to work on the project and implement new features on the App Store.</p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Search for the Good</strong> is a platform under development that connects individuals, projects, and brands dedicated to making a positive impact in the world. By fostering connections between purpose-driven people, impactful projects, and trusted brands, the platform aims to inspire and amplify good. Search for the Good addresses issues in social media such as superficial engagement, negativity, and passive consumption by creating a carefully curated community focused on authenticity and real-world action.</p>

                <h3>Purpose and Solution</h3>
                <p>The platform seeks to counteract the negative aspects of traditional social media by providing a space where people can connect over shared values, collaborate on meaningful projects, and discover brands that prioritize social good. Search for the Good encourages genuine connections, volunteering, mentorship, and collaboration in a positive environment.</p>

                <h3>Current Progress</h3>
                <p>I am actively building the platform and have started engaging with potential users. I’m also collaborating with two organizations, Greenpop and Goodgym, to develop features that support their community initiatives.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Get an Interview:</strong> Prospective members undergo an interview to confirm their commitment to positive impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a Profile:</strong> Members share their values and intentions, and they can list any projects or brands they are involved with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the Platform:</strong> Members can connect with others, explore projects to support or learn from, and discover brands aligned with their values.</li>

            <div class="section-content">
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Knit</strong> is a community-building platform aimed at enhancing the quality of life for residents in long-term care facilities by connecting them with local businesses that provide classes, workshops, and events. The platform was developed during a hackathon, where it won second place, and the team built a prototype on Figma.</p>
                
                <h3>Purpose and Solution</h3>
                <p>Knit addresses the issue of social isolation among older adults, especially those in long-term care homes, which became even more pronounced during COVID-19. By creating a network of activities and experiences, Knit helps residents remain socially active and mentally stimulated. The platform connects residents with diverse, engaging activities, fostering a sense of community and well-being.</p>

                <h3>Key Features and Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subscription Model:</strong> Knit generates revenue through facility and provider subscriptions, where long-term care facilities pay a monthly fee per resident, and local businesses pay to feature their services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Approach:</strong> Focused on long-term care homes in Vancouver, Knit differentiates itself from other community platforms by catering specifically to the elderly population.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative Model:</strong> Through partnerships with local businesses, Knit offers an array of events and experiences, allowing residents to explore new skills, activities, and social connections.</li>
                </ul>
