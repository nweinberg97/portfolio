                <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
                <p>Many individuals lack a supportive, structured environment to pursue their health and wellness goals. Existing platforms are often too broad or impersonal, which limits effective accountability and motivation for lasting change.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Research and Ideation</h2>
                <p>Through research, I found a need for a platform that supports small, committed groups. Insights from user interviews revealed that people sought accountability partners and intimate groups to help them stay motivated. This led to the creation of Circles, where users could find like-minded individuals and foster meaningful connections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Group Formation:</strong> Users form circles based on goals and availability, creating small, dedicated communities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meeting Structures:</strong> Customizable templates include goal-setting, check-ins, and structured activities to maintain focus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persona-Driven Features:</strong> Features like scheduling, goal assistance, and curated resources ensure relevance to each user’s journey.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leader Support:</strong> Tools for leaders, including 24/7 support, coaching, and expert content, ensure effective facilitation.</li>

                <h2>Implementation and Prototyping</h2>
