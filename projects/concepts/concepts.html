                <p>Circles is a platform that creates micro-communities of 5-7 individuals who 
                    collaborate to reach shared health goals. By providing structured meeting 
                    formats and resources, Circles fosters support and accountability, helping 
                    users build sustainable habits.

                <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
                <p>Many individuals lack a supportive, structured environment to pursue their health and wellness goals. 
                    Existing platforms are often too broad or impersonal, which limits effective accountability and 
                    motivation for lasting change.

                <h3>Research and Ideation</h3>
                <p>Through research, I found a need for a platform that supports small, committed groups. Insights 
                    from user interviews revealed that people sought accountability partners and intimate groups to 
                    help them stay motivated. This led to the creation of Circles, where users could find like-minded 
                    individuals and foster meaningful connections.

                    flexibility, adaptable to various wellness themes. Through Circles, I demonstrated my ability to create user-centered, impactful 
                    solutions that integrate digital tools with human connection.

            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, as digital fitness became increasingly prevalent, users were often overwhelmed by options and 
                lacked inspiration for maintaining an active lifestyle. Fitness brands also faced challenges in engaging users and staying 
                relevant in the rapidly shifting digital space. MEMO bridges this gap by offering a curated platform for fitness exploration, 
                while supporting brands in adapting to these changes.

                <p>To shape MEMO’s features and focus, interviews were conducted with four fitness studios. These discussions highlighted the 
                    need for a platform that could personalize fitness experiences and facilitate connections between users and innovative fitness 
                    brands. Based on this feedback, MEMO was developed as a content discovery platform that supports both users and fitness studios.
