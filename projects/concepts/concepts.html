                <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
                <p>Many individuals lack a supportive, structured environment to pursue their health and wellness goals. 
                    Existing platforms are often too broad or impersonal, which limits effective accountability and 
                    motivation for lasting change.

                <h3>Research and Ideation</h3>
                <p>Through research, I found a need for a platform that supports small, committed groups. Insights 
                    from user interviews revealed that people sought accountability partners and intimate groups to 
                    help them stay motivated. This led to the creation of Circles, where users could find like-minded 
                    individuals and foster meaningful connections.

            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, as digital fitness became increasingly prevalent, users were often overwhelmed by options and 
                lacked inspiration for maintaining an active lifestyle. Fitness brands also faced challenges in engaging users and staying 
                relevant in the rapidly shifting digital space. MEMO bridges this gap by offering a curated platform for fitness exploration, 
                while supporting brands in adapting to these changes.

                <p>To shape MEMO’s features and focus, interviews were conducted with four fitness studios. These discussions highlighted the 
                    need for a platform that could personalize fitness experiences and facilitate connections between users and innovative fitness 
                    brands. Based on this feedback, MEMO was developed as a content discovery platform that supports both users and fitness studios.

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p><strong>Tender,</strong> the dating app for foodies, is a concept that reinvents dating by connecting users over a shared love of food. Men showcase their 
                cooking skills through videos, which women rate to create matches based on mutual culinary interests. The app encourages users to discover 
                new cuisines and develop cooking skills, fostering a unique food-centric dating experience. Tender fosters genuine connections over shared passions for 
                food, aiming to make dating enjoyable again by focusing on meaningful, activity-based interactions.
            </p>
            <h3>Monetization Strategy</h3>
            <p>Revenue would come from partnerships with local restaurants and a premium membership tier. Premium users gain access to exclusive features, 
                such as meal prep services, cooking tutorials, and discounts on dining experiences, adding extra value and unique culinary insights. </p>

            <h3>Features & Flow</h3>
            <p>Tender offers a streamlined, engaging experience that encourages users to connect over food. Here’s how it works:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Step 1: Share Your Cooking – Users upload videos of their best dishes, showcasing their culinary skills and personalities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Step 2: Discover & Match – Through a swipe-based feature, users can browse dishes and rate each other’s cooking. Matches are 
                        based on mutual interests and ratings, creating meaningful connections rooted in food.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Step 3: Book Your Date – Once matched, users can book a dinner date at a curated list of restaurants directly within the app. 
                        The in-app scheduling system makes it easy to plan the first date, taking the guesswork out of choosing a venue.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Additional Features</h3>
            <p>
                Cooking Classes – Users can sign up for cooking classes, either solo or with a match, to learn new skills and enjoy a shared experience.
                Restaurant Recommendations – A curated list of trendy restaurants is available to help users find unique dining spots, making dates 
                even more memorable

            <h3>Branding & Logo Design</h3>
            <p><strong>Tender's</strong> brand identity revolves around food and fun, using playful elements to reinforce its unique 
                positioning in the dating space.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tagline:</strong> “Let’s spice things up” captures the dual themes of food and romance, enticing users 
                        to explore new flavors and connections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Logo Concept:</strong> The T-bone steak logo is both playful and meaningful—the “T” represents Tender, 
                        symbolizing both the app’s name and the concept of “tenderness” in relationships. The T-bone steak also aligns 
                        with the app's food-centric theme, adding a memorable visual anchor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Visual Aesthetic:</strong> The app incorporates food-themed imagery in its promotional materials, including backgrounds 
                        with dishes and cooking-related visuals. This consistent food-centric aesthetic helps establish Tender as a space 
                        for food lovers, creating an inviting and authentic look.
